Welcome to the Endergy repository!

Endergy is an addon for the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. It focuses on magical machines and artifice powered by energy extracted from denizens of the End. It is inspired by magic mods from Java Edition such as [Botania](https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania) or [Embers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/embers).
